## 💡 Reflection
The ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 held at UTM Johor Bahru gave me exposure to emerging technologies, especially quantum computing. I learned about the potential use of quantum technology in areas such as data processing and information security. Although the topic was challenging, the summit helped me understand the importance of future technologies. This experience increased my understanding of how Technology and Information System will evolve in the future. It encouraged me to be more open to learning new technologies and to prepare myself for future developments in the technology field.
